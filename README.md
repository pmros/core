> "tsers!"


## Motivation

*What if your application was just a pure function?* That's a very interesting
idea introduced by [Cycle.js](http://cycle.js.org/). Although the idea is nice,
the actual implementation of Cycle is not. The development is driven by vague
concepts such as "read/write effects" and "pureness" of the `main`, resulting
inconsistency in driver implementations (even among the official ones!) and leaving
the real issues open - the entire framework is designed to create a "cycle" around
the application. However developers must still implement their own "sub-cycles"
and "isolation" inside their "pure apps".

Despite its implementation flaws, Cycle has some great concepts. Maintaining
those concepts and implementing them properly is the goal of **TSERS**:

* `main` is just a signal transducer `input$ => output$`
* Drivers encapsulate the side-effects
* `Model-View-Intent` instead of `Intent-Model-View`
* No impure "isolation", just pure signal processing by using `filter` and `map`
* Declarative and explicit

## Hello world

The mandatory "Hello world" written with TSERS:
```javascript
import {Observable as O} from "rx"
import TSERS as "@tsers/core"
import makeReactDOM as "@tsers/react"

const main = T => in$ => {
  const {DOM: {h, prepare, events}, decompose, compose} = T

  const [actions] = decompose(in$, "append$")
  return intent(view(model(actions)))

  function model({append$}) {
    const msg$ = append$
      .startWith("Tsers")
      .scan((acc, s) => acc + s)
    return msg$
  }

  function view(msg$) {
    const vdom$ = msg$.map(msg =>
      h("div", [
        h("h1", msg),
        h("button.add", "Click me!")
      ]))
    return prepare(vdom$)
  }

  function intent(vdom$) {
    const append$ = events(vdom$, ".add", "click").map(() => "!")
    const loop$ = compose({append$})
    const out$ = compose({DOM: vdom$})
    return [out$, loop$]
  }
}

const [Transducers, signal$, executor] = TSERS({
  DOM: makeReactDOM("#app")
})
const { run }Â = Transducers
executor(run(signal$, main(Transducers)))
```


## What is different compared to Cycle?

TSERS makes a clear distinction between signals and transducers:

Cycle's `main` is:
```javascript
const main = sources => sinks
```
Where `sources` can be either streams or transducers or stream generators or
combination of those and `sinks` are streams of signals going to the "outside world".

TSERS' `main` is:
```javascript
const main = Transducers => input$ => output$
```
Where `Transducers` is always a collection of signal transducer functions,
`input$` is a stream of events coming from the "outside world" and `output$` is a
stream of signals going to the "outside world".

And same applies for drivers. Cycle driver is a function:
```javascript
function driver(sink$) {
  return sources
}
```
Where `sink$` is a stream of signals coming from sinks and sources can be
either streams or transducers or stream generators or combination of those.

TSERS' `main` driver is a function:
```javascript
function driver() {
  return [Transducers, signal$, executor: output$ => {}]
}
```
Where `signal$` is a stream of signals coming from the "outside world",
`Transducers` is a collection of transducer functions and `executor` is
an interpreter that subscribes to the `output$` signals (= sinks in Cycle)
and creates side-effects based on those signals.


## Usage

TSERS provides only one public function via `default` exports. That function takes
an object of drivers and returns an array containing `Transducers`, `signal$` and
`executor`.

```javascript
import TSERS from "@tsers/core"
import makeReactDOM from "@tsers/react"
import main from "./your-app"

const [Transducers, signals, executor] = TSERS({
  DOM: makeReactDOM("#app")
})
```

### Signals

Signals are just a stream of events coming from the "outside world". These events
can be anything: user keyboard clicks, mouse movements, messages from WebSockets,
sounds from guitar pedals etc.

The signal values are `{key, val}` objects where `val` contains the signal data
and `key` is the name of the driver that emitted the signal (e.g. `DOM`). It's
up to driver's implementation to decide whether it emits input signals or not -
some  drivers might emit them (like web-socket driver) while others might not.

### Transducers

Transducers are the "swiss army knife" that actually processes the input signals
to output signals. Don't get distracted by the name: [a transducer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transducer)
is just a function that transforms signals `a` to `b`:
```
Transducer :: a$ => b$
```

As you can notice, `main` is actually just another signal transducer.
Observable's `map`, `filter` and `flatMap` (for example) are also transducers.

`Transducers` (from `TSERS`) is a JSON object that contains all transducers
from drivers, grouped by drivers name (e.g. if you are using `DOM` driver then
you have for example `Transducers.DOM.events` transducer).

TSERS provides also a small set of built-in transducers for common tasks.
The most important ones are: `decompose`, `run` and `compose`.

#### `decompose :: (in$, ...keys) => [{[key]: [signals-of-key]}, rest$]`

As told before, input signals are just a stream of key-value pairs.`decompose` is
a helper function meant to "extract" specific input signals from the rest.

![decompose](doc/decompose.png)

```javascript
const input$ = O.of({key: "Foo", val: "foo!"}, {key: "Bar", val: "bar"}, {key: "Foo", val: "foo?"}, {key: "lol", val: "bal"})
const [decomposed, rest$] = decompose(input$, "Foo", "Bar")
decomposed.Foo.subscribe(::console.log)   // => "foo!", "foo?"
decomposed.Bar.subscribe(::console.log)   // => "bar"
rest$.subscribe(::console.log)            // =>  {key: "lol", val: "bal"}
```

#### `compose :: ({[key]: [signals-of-key]}, rest$ = O.never()) => output$`

`compose` is the opposite of `decompose` - it maps the given input values to the
`{key,val}` pairs based on the input template and merges them. For convenience, it also
takes rest input signals (key-value pairs) as a second (optional) argument and
merges them to the final output stream.

![compose](doc/compose.png)
```javascript
const foo$ = O.just("foo!")
const bar$ = O.just("bar..")
const rest$ = O.just({key: "lol", value: "bal"})
const out$ = compose({Foo: foo$, Bar: bar$}, rest$)
out$.subscribe(::console.log)   // => {key: "Foo", val: "foo!"}, {key: "Bar", val: "bar.."}, {key: "lol", val: "bal"}
```

Also note that `compose` and `decompose` are transitive:
```javascript
const input$ = ...
const keys = [ ... ]
const output$ = compose(...decompose(input$, ...keys))
// output$ and input$ streams produce same values
```

#### `run :: (input$, (input$ => [output$, loop$]) => output$`

`run` is the way to loop signals from downstream back to upstream. It takes
input signals and a transducer function producing `output$` and `loop$` signals
array - `output$` signals are passed through as they are, but `loop$` signals
are merged back to the transducer function as input signals.

Note that you can nest `run` as much as you like! Before the `loop$` signals are
merged to the input, they are "masked" with (`ext=false`) key. This key ensures
that `loop$` signals are "private": parent's `loop$` signals can never appear
as its child's `input$`.

`run` accepts the return value in many formats: you can omit the second array
element and return only `[output$]` without `loop$` signals (equivalent to
`[output$, O.never()]`. You can also return plain `output$` stream which is equivalent
to `[output$]`.


![run](doc/run.png)
```javascript
const input$ = compose({Foo: O.just("tsers")}, O.never(), true)
const main = input$ => {
  const [{Bar: bar$, Foo: foo$}] = decompose(input$, "Bar", "Foo")
  const output$ = bar$.map(x => x + "!")
  const loop$ = compose({Bar: foo$.map(x => x + "?")})
  return [output$, loop$]
}

const output$ = run(input$, main)
output$.subscribe(::console.log)  // => "tsers?!"
```


### Executor

`executor` is like Cycle's `run` but it doesn't make signal proxying from
`output$` back to `input$` (TSERS already has `run` for it!). Its only task
is to subscribe to the output signals, interpret them and execute the
side-effects if necessary.

`executor` also ensures that output signals are routed correctly to their
drivers' executors. Routing is done by using signal `key` signals having key `X`
are routed to driver `X` and so on.

```javascript
const main = T => in$ => {
  ...
  return compose({
    DOM: vdom$,
    WS: message$
  })
}

const [T, signal$, execute] = TSERS({DOM: domDriver(), WS: wsDriver()})
// vdom$ events are routed to "DOM" driver's executor
// and message$ events are routed to "WS" driver's executor
execute(T.run(singnal$, main(T)))
```

`executor` returns a `dispose` function which can be called to dispose ("stop")
the execution:
```javascript
const dispose = execute(output$)
setTimeout(dispose, 1000)  // stop after 1 sec
```


### Running the app

We know that:

1. `signal$ = input$`
2. `main :: Transducers => input$ => output$`
3. `Tranducers.run :: (input$, input$ => [output$, loop$]) => output$`
4. `executor :: output$ => dispose`

Let's compose those:
```javascript
import TSERS from "@tsers/core"
import makeReactDOM from "@tsers/react"
import main from "./your-app"

const [Transducers, signal$, executor] = TSERS({
  DOM: makeReactDOM("#app")
})
const { run }Â = Transducers

const dispose = executor(run(signal$, main(Transducers)))
```

Now you may understand why the signature of `main` is `Transducers => input$ => output$`:
it allows you to pass down the transducers and use them at the same time without partial
application or currying. It's all about composition. It's TSERS!


## Model-View-Intent

The one major difference between TSERS and Cycle is that TSERS implements the real `MVI`
whereas Cycle implements `IMV`. In practice this means that in Cycle apps, the border
of **M**odel and **I**ntent becomes blurry when there is a cross-dependency between
them. The simplest case is a form validation:

1. In order to send the form to the server, you must have the form values (intent depends on model)
2. In order to show an AJAX spinner during the validation, the send status must be
stored to the form (model depends on intent)

Of course that is solvable with `IMV` and there are more or less elegant solutions
either leaking memory or not. In `MVI` however, there is no exception - you can
**always** apply `MVI` and loop the model dependencies back to input by using `run`.

```javascript
const main = T => in$ => {
  const {DOM, HTTP, decompose, compose} = T
  const [actions] = decompose(in$, "validate$", "validated$")
  return intent(view(model(actions)))

  function model({validate$, validated$}) {
    const form$ = validate$.map(toShowSpinnerMod)
      .merge(validated$.map(toAddValidationResultsAndRemoveSpinnerMod))
      .startWith(someInitialValues)
      .scan(applyMods)
      .shareReplay(1)
    return form$
  }

  function view(form$) {
    return [form$, buildFormVDOM(form$)]
  }

  function intent([form$, vdom$]) {
    const validate$ = DOM.events(vdom$, "button.validate", "click")
    const validated$ = HTTP.req(form$.sample(validate$).map(toReqObject)).switch()
    const out$ = compose({DOM: vdom$, value$: form$})
    const loop$ = compose({validate$, validated$})
    return [out$, loop$]
  }
}

// index.js
executor(run(signal$, main(Transducers)))
```

// == decompose(in$, key)[0][key]

// run :: (in$, (in$ => [out$, loop$])) => out$


// decomposeLatest :: (out$$, ...keys) => [{[key]: [signals-of-key]}, rest$]
const out$$ = form$.map(f => run(in$, Child(Transducers, f.childValue)))
const [{DOM, value$}, rest$] = decomposeLatest(out$$, "DOM", "value$")

// listDecomposeLatest :: (outArr$, (val => out$), ...keys) => [{[key]: [signals-of-key]}, rest$]
const persons$ = form$.map(f => f.persons)
const [{DOM, value$}, rest$] = listDecomposeLatest(persons$, person => run(in$, Person(Transducers, person)),
  "DOM", "value$")
// DOM is now an array of latest DOM values of Person components
// value$ is now an array of latest values of Persons
